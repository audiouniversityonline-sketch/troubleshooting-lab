   content.js - Troubleshooting Lab scenario data
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   The level/challenge library, split out of index.html so new
   scenarios can be dripped in by editing this one small file
   instead of the app shell. Loaded as a plain <script> BEFORE
   the app's babel blocks, so keep it plain JS (arrow functions
   are fine; no JSX).

     window.LEVELS          - the free Essentials tier, in order.
     window.PRACTICE        - the paid Practice Mode scenario (endless reps).
     window.PRACTICE_FAULTS - the fault pool Practice Mode draws from.
     window.FEEDBACK_MODE   - the paid ring-out trainer (endless wedges).

   Rules that keep monthly drops from disturbing student progress:
     - Every entry has a STABLE id. Progress is saved by id.
     - Only ever APPEND new scenarios. Never renumber existing ones.

   GLOSSARY — the single source of truth for every definition the
   student reads. Written and approved by Kyle 2026-07-20; see
   GLOSSARY.md for sourcing and the accuracy rules.

   A lesson does NOT carry prose. It carries `defs: ['wedge', ...]`
   and the engine renders the term/definition list. This is
   deliberate: there is no free-text field to fill, so a lesson
   cannot contain scene-setting, instructions, or a description of
   something the student can already see on screen.

   Instructions live in the step's `text` (the green DO THIS).
   Nowhere else.

   Adding a term? Add it here once. Never reword it per lesson.

   GLOSSARY_ANCHORS — hovering a definition highlights the thing itself
   on the board. Each value is a CSS selector matched against the
   spotlight anchors the console and stage already carry (`data-walk`),
   so one term can light up EVERY instance: hover "fader" and all the
   channel faders plus the master fader light up together.

   A term is listed only when the highlight is HONEST. Concepts with no
   single home on screen (signal, patch, cross-patch, headroom, clipping,
   gain structure, feedback, ring out, pre-fader, monitor mix, line
   check) are deliberately absent, and the UI shows no hover affordance
   for them. A hover that lights up the wrong thing teaches the wrong
   thing; a hover that lights up nothing feels broken.

   Microphone and DI types are absent for that reason: the stage source
   cards share one `src-` anchor with no per-type distinction, so
   "condenser microphone" would ring the dynamics too.

//                the job to do, not a problem description.
//   - hint     : a plain nudge if they're stuck
//   - solution : what the fix was (shown on solve)
//   - task     : true for setup/procedure levels where nothing is broken.
//                Changes the UI framing: TASK label instead of the red
//                SYMPTOM, TASK COMPLETE instead of MIX RESTORED, Recap
//                instead of Fix.
//   - requirePowerOn : win on power state, not signal. Passes when the
//                console, power amp, and both wedges are all on (in an order
//                that didn't pop). Use with conditions: [] for a pure
//                power-on lesson that doesn't need signal flow.
//   - requirePowerOff : the mirror image. Passes when the master fader is
//                pulled down, every powered box (wedges + main speakers, or the
//                amp on a passive rig) is off, and the console is off — in an
//                order that didn't pop. Turning the console off while a
//                powered box is still live pops it (cause 'mixer_off_pop'),
//                so the order the level teaches is: speakers first, console
//                last.
//   - requireZeroed : zero-the-console check. Passes when every channel is
//                back to its default state (gain, aux1/aux2 and fader down,
//                muted, pan centered, HPF and +48V off) and the master is
//                down AND muted. Pair with requirePowerOff for the full
//                end-of-night routine.
//   - verifyEach : [{source, dest, min, label}] — verify outputs one at a
//                time. Each destination LATCHES checked the moment its source
//                reaches it (>= min) and stays checked, so the win does NOT
//                need them all live at once. Win when every entry is checked.
//                Use with conditions: [] and an explicit involves.
//   - gainStructure : { refChannel?, unity, faderTol, inputBand? } — gain-
//                structure lesson. Win also requires the reference channel's
//                fader AND the master fader to sit at unity (within faderTol).
//                Optional inputBand [lo, hi] also requires the ref channel's
//                input (chanIn baseline) to sit in a healthy band, so the
//                student sets the input gain by hand (pair with requirePflCheck
//                to make them verify it in PFL first). Omit refChannel for a
//                master-only unity check (The Gig: playback ends turned down,
//                so no single channel is pinned).
//   - conditions, sabotage, defaultInspect, topology, involves: engine fields
//   - sabotage(s, rng) : rng is a seeded PRNG the app passes on every load.
//                Challenges place their fault with it (randomized reps);
//                Essentials ignore it and stay deterministic.
//   - par      : challenges only. The move count of a systematic check,
//                shown against the student's own move count in the debrief.
//   - hintAuto : presentation override. Defaults: Essentials show the hint
//                up front, challenges keep it behind a "Need a hint?" button.
//
// Prose rule (Kyle, 2026-06-10): write simple and clear, not "in character."
// Don't reach for engineer slang or scene-setting to sound like the niche.
// Plain sentences that say what's happening beat flavor every time, and
// they're easier for beginners.
//
// REFOCUSED 2026-06-10 PM (Kyle): the free Essentials are now setting up a
// system and learning the standard input types, as a continuous on-site build.
// The 10 lessons, in order:
//   1 Patch the System    - connect everything per the input list (added
//                           2026-06-11: inputs, outputs, snake by color code)
//   2 Power-On Sequence   - bring the rig up in the right order (active speakers)
//   3 Set the Input Level - PFL the playback, set gain, faders to unity
//   4 Test the Wedges     - send to each wedge, verify one at a time
//   5 Mic Inputs          - dynamic (no power) + condenser (+48V)
//   6 DI Boxes            - passive (no power) + active (+48V)
//   7 Monitor Mix         - send a wedge mix
//   8 Feedback Awareness  - keep the monitor loop under control
//   9 The Gig             - final exam: full pre-show check from a cold start
//                           (speakers verified with playback, then the band)
//  10 Power-Down          - zero the console, then shut down in the right order
// The early levels build on each other (each starts where the last ended).
// Troubleshooting faults (cable, gain, fader, mute, pan, phantom, master,
// speaker, feedback, crosspatch) live in the paid PRACTICE_FAULTS pool, where
// "something's broken, fix it" is the point.
// Source types: Vocal Mic 1 = dynamic, Vocal Mic 2 = condenser (+48V); Bass DI
// = passive, Keyboard DI = active (diActive, needs +48V like a condenser). The
// 5/6 playback is a FOH line input on channel 5 (no snake port).
// Extra contract field (2026-06-11):
//   - requirePatch : win requires the physical patch to match the paperwork
//                (the Input List): sources on snake inputs 1-4, input tails on
//                their console channels, console outputs into snake returns
//                1-6 (outFan), and speaker lines on their numbered out ports
//                (outPatch). Used by Patch the System and every practice rep.
// Ids renumbered 2026-06-10 and again 2026-06-11 (Patch the System became
// lesson 1), both pre-launch. After launch the append-only rule is absolute.

// --- Adaptive-hint helper --------------------------------------------------
// Each lesson can define hints: [{ text, done(ctx) }]. The brief shows only the
// steps not yet done, one more per click, so a hint never points at something
// the engineer already handled. ctx carries the live state, audio, and the same

// its step actually gets done. hintReaches mirrors the checklist's level read.

// PRACTICE MODE — the paid tier. One endless scenario instead of a fixed
// challenge list: every rep starts with the band up and playing, then breaks
// 1-3 things (the FAULTS selector in the top bar) drawn at random from the
// fault pool below. The student finds and fixes them. The fault placement is
// seeded per rep, so Reset replays the same rep and the next rep is always
// new. Locked on the free tier; ?tier=member unlocks it.
//
// This is the sustainability model: a new training rep costs zero authoring
// time. Growing the product = adding entries to PRACTICE_FAULTS (data-only,
// edit this file and deploy) or new fault physics (quarterly engine work —
// hum + ground lift, cable crackle, and friends land here as new pool
// entries when their engine support exists).
//
// Presentation (handled by the app, not by fields here):
//   - Symptom only; the hint hides behind a "Need a hint?" button.
//   - The solve shows a DEBRIEF (moves vs par, hints, rep count), never an
//     answer key.
//   - The app sets window.PRACTICE_FAULT_COUNT from the FAULTS selector
//     before calling sabotage, and reads window.PRACTICE_LAST (par + fault
//     keys for the debrief) after.

// master at unity, PA trim 0.6 (-6 dB) -> per-source, per-side PA contribution
// 0.27 (conditions min 0.2 with margin); the main bus power-sums to about

// 0.69 and fails, and at the lightest valid push a surgical one-band cut leaves
// the level at ~0.70, still over the line. Push harder and a second band joins
// (~0.79) — the real "back it off and cut" lesson, never an opening wall.

// FEEDBACK MODE — the ring-out trainer (Kyle, 2026-06-11 PM; realism pass
// 2026-06-12 from ring-out research). Practice Mode trains diagnosis; this
// trains the monitor engineer's core physical skill: pushing a wedge toward
// a target level while killing feedback frequency by frequency. The wedge
// carries the FULL ISO third-octave graphic EQ (63 Hz to 16 kHz, 25 bands)
// and a per-rep random feedback profile. The rhythm the mode teaches is the
// real one: up, ring, back off a touch, cut a few dB, up again.
//
// What the research pinned down (Carvin Audio, Rane Note 158, Sweetwater,
// Yamaha, QSC ring-out guides), and how the profile encodes it:
//   - Feedback starts at the single highest peak in the loop response, and
//     the first few peaks stand well above the rest. So: a ladder of 3-4
//     genuinely hot bands (the hottest rings earliest), placed in the real
//     wedge trouble zones (low-mid hoot, midrange ring, presence whistle).
//   - Real cuts are a few dB, not slammed sliders ("notches on the order of
//     a couple of dB, not tens of dB" — Rane). The ladder is tuned so 2-7 dB
//     per band is enough at the target level.
//   - Pros STOP after those few cuts: past the top peaks the response is a
//     crowd of near-ties, and more EQ just wrecks tone for no added gain.
//     So: every other band is a tame floor that only rings when the send is
//     pushed far past the target (the real "everything rings at once" wall),
//     and the toneGate fails the rep if the cuts go far beyond what the

// Breaks the one overwhelming "Patch the System" lesson into digestible
// pieces and adds fault-finding. The whole course is objective: a cable is in
// the right port or it isn't. Setup lessons grade with requirePatch (the
// identity check at staging.html); the disconnected-cable lesson grades with a
// signal condition (the source has to reach the PA again). All MX-8.
// Board note: every lesson runs on the MX-8 (loadLevel passes defaultState as
// the sabotage base). requirePatch asserts the identity map (vocal->1,
// vocal2->2, guitar->3, laptop->4, identity fan-out, home returns), so a setup
// lesson can disconnect PART of that map and leave the rest intact: the user
// restores their part and the whole map reads identity again and the win
// latches. First slice (read the list, patch the outputs, disconnected cable);
// cross-patch, snakes and sub-snakes, and a whole sub-snake down come next.

   SOUNDCHECK (members) — the 16-channel band, start to finish.

   Built from Kyle's own Soundcheck Checklist (Drive: Production /
   Lead Magnets / Soundcheck Checklist). Section by section:
     sc1  = §1 Line Check
     sc2, sc3 = §2 "Set Preamp Gain with PFL", by sub-snake group
     sc4  = §2 "Send Input Channel to Main Speakers"
     sc5, sc6 = §2 "Mixing Monitors from FOH"

   THE RAISE YOUR HAND METHOD, WITHOUT HANDS. The checklist's monitor
   section is built on it: "Raise your hand until you have enough of
   THIS channel in your monitor. When you have enough, put your hand
   down." The sim has no hands, so the method is carried by two things
   that ARE checkable:
     - STEP ORDER. Each performer's own signal goes into their own
       wedge first (sc5), and only then does anyone else's (sc6).
       "Always send the musician their own signal first."
     - A MAX on everybody else. sc6 wins only while each player's own
       signal stays ABOVE what got added around it, so "the most of
       their own sound" is the win condition, not a suggestion.
   The overheads rule from the checklist ("do not send drum overheads
   to the monitors") is a max of near-zero on ohl/ohr in every wedge.

// LIVE SOUND 101 COMPANION TRACK — Kyle 2026-07-24
// The Lab's exercises re-ordered to run alongside the Live Sound 101 course,
// one group per course lesson, so a student finishing a video can open the Lab
// and find the matching hands-on exercise by its lesson number.
//
// `code` is the LS101 lesson coordinate. NOTE the Section 4 numbering assumes
// the new "Powering Up the System" video is inserted as S4.L1, which bumps
// Channel Strip -> 4.2, Busses -> 4.3, Calibrating -> 4.4.
//
// Lessons with NO exercise (deliberately, not an oversight):
//   1.2 Tracing        - same skill as 1.1, folded in
//   2.1 Power/cables/placement - venue planning, no console action
//   3.4 Consumer Devices - the real takeaway is gain structure, folded into 4.4
//   4.2 Channel Strip  - would need channel EQ + compressor on every strip;
//                        Kyle's existing walkthrough videos cover it instead
//   5.4 Workbox        - physical kit
//
// PENDING mechanics (rows appear once the mechanic is built):
//   3.3 hum / ground lift, 4.3 main-mix assign + pre/post fader,
//   3.2 mic placement (null aiming + mic vs the mains)
