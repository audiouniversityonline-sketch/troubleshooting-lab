   content.js - Troubleshooting Lab scenario data
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   The level/challenge library, split out of index.html so new
   scenarios can be dripped in by editing this one small file
   instead of the app shell. Loaded as a plain <script> BEFORE
   the app's babel blocks, so keep it plain JS (arrow functions
   are fine; no JSX).

     window.LEVELS         - the free Essentials tier, in order.
     window.CHALLENGE_BANK - paid-tier scenarios (dormant stubs).

   Rules that keep monthly drops from disturbing student progress:
     - Every entry has a STABLE id. Progress is saved by id.
     - Only ever APPEND new scenarios. Never renumber existing ones.
   ============================================================ */

// LEVELS — the Essentials free tier.
//
// Contract per level (kept intentionally small so the prose surface stays
// editable):
//   - title    : 2-4 words
//   - symptom  : what's going on, in plain language. For task levels this is
//                the job to do, not a problem description.
//   - hint     : a plain nudge if they're stuck
//   - solution : what the fix was (shown on solve)
//   - task     : true for setup/procedure levels where nothing is broken.
//                Changes the UI framing: TASK label instead of the red
//                SYMPTOM, TASK COMPLETE instead of MIX RESTORED, Recap
//                instead of Fix.
//   - requirePowerOn : win on power state, not signal. Passes when the
//                console, power amp, and both wedges are all on (in an order
//                that didn't pop). Use with conditions: [] for a pure
//                power-on lesson that doesn't need signal flow.
//   - verifyEach : [{source, dest, min, label}] — verify outputs one at a
//                time. Each destination LATCHES checked the moment its source
//                reaches it (>= min) and stays checked, so the win does NOT
//                need them all live at once. Win when every entry is checked.
//                Use with conditions: [] and an explicit involves.
//   - gainStructure : { refChannel, unity, faderTol, inputBand? } — gain-
//                structure lesson. Win also requires the reference channel's
//                fader AND the master fader to sit at unity (within faderTol).
//                Optional inputBand [lo, hi] also requires the ref channel's
//                input (chanIn baseline) to sit in a healthy band, so the
//                student sets the input gain by hand (pair with requirePflCheck
//                to make them verify it in PFL first).
//   - conditions, sabotage, defaultInspect, topology, involves: engine fields
//
// Prose rule (Kyle, 2026-06-10): write simple and clear, not "in character."
// Don't reach for engineer slang or scene-setting to sound like the niche.
// Plain sentences that say what's happening beat flavor every time, and
// they're easier for beginners.
//
// REFOCUSED 2026-06-10 PM (Kyle): the free Essentials are now setting up a
// system and learning the standard input types, as a continuous on-site build.
// The 7 lessons, in order:
//   1 Power-On Sequence   - bring the rig up in the right order (active speakers)
//   2 Set the Input Level - PFL the playback, set gain, faders to unity
//   3 Test the System     - send to each output, set the room level
//   4 Mic Inputs          - dynamic (no power) + condenser (+48V)
//   5 DI Boxes            - passive (no power) + active (+48V)
//   6 Monitor Mix         - send a wedge mix
//   7 Feedback Awareness  - keep the monitor loop under control
// The early levels build on each other (each starts where the last ended).
// Troubleshooting faults (Patch, Gain, PFL, Signal Path, Mute, Pan) live in the
// paid CHALLENGE_BANK, where "something's broken, fix it" is the point.
// Source types: Vocal Mic 1 = dynamic, Vocal Mic 2 = condenser (+48V); Bass DI
// = passive, Keyboard DI = active (diActive, needs +48V like a condenser). The
// 5/6 playback is a FOH line input on channel 5 (no snake port).
// Ids renumbered for this arc on 2026-06-10, pre-launch. After launch the
// append-only rule is absolute.
