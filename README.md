# Troubleshooting Lab

An interactive mixing-console training simulator for [Audio University](https://www.youtube.com/@AudioUniversity). Single-page app, no build step (React + Babel via CDN). Free Essentials tier acts as the lead magnet; paid challenge scenarios drip in over time for members.

## Files

Two parallel pairs — a sandbox and production. `IS_STAGING` auto-detects which is which from the content-script filename, so the two HTML files stay identical except for the one `<script src>` line.

- **`staging.html` + `content-staging.js`** — the development sandbox. Do all work here.
- **`index.html` + `content.js`** — production (the live embed). Promote by copying `staging.html` → `index.html` (pointing the one `<script src>` at `content.js?v=N`) and `content-staging.js` → `content.js`, then bump `N`.
- The app shell holds the engine, UI, and synthesized audio; the content file is the scenario library (`window.LEVELS`, `window.START_HERE`, `window.FEEDBACK_MODE`, etc.). **Edit the content file when adding or changing levels.**

## Hosting

Served via GitHub Pages, embedded in an iframe on the Audio University Circle community. A commit to `main` auto-deploys within about a minute.

One production build, three iframe embeds that differ only by URL query (all share the full-bleed wrapper with `allow="autoplay; fullscreen"`). Base URL: `https://audiouniversityonline-sketch.github.io/troubleshooting-lab/`

| Variant | Query | Placement | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Members | `?tier=member&v=N` | Members-only Circle page (behind the access group) | Everything unlocked, no email gate |
| Free — cold | `?v=N` | YouTube descriptions + any public link | Full free funnel; email gate at the finale |
| Free — opted in | `?optedin=1&v=N` | Email sales copy + the Circle Resource Library (both audiences are already on the list) | Same free funnel, email gate skipped |

`&v=N` is a cache-buster the browser/CDN key on (the root `index.html` shell is cached separately from `content.js?v=N`). **On every production push, bump both `content.js?v=N` and the `&v=N` in the embeds** so members get the new shell on first load instead of a stale cached one. The `?tier=member` unlock is soft — the real paywall is the Circle access group. See `funnel-plan-2026-07-10.md` for the full distribution map and rationale.

## Progress and the drip model

Member progress is saved in the browser via `localStorage`, keyed by each level's **stable `id`**. Two rules keep monthly content drops from disturbing anyone's progress:

1. **Every scenario has a stable `id`.** Progress is stored by id, not by position.
2. **Append only. Never renumber existing levels.** New scenarios go on the end with new ids.

Follow those two and you can drop new levels any time without resetting a single student.

## Audio

The app synthesizes its sound in the browser with the Web Audio API. It loads no audio files, so there is nothing to break across hosts. Sound starts off and resumes on the first click (browser autoplay policy).
